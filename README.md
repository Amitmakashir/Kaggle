The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of implementing a simple "logistic regression" or "logit" model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

A lot of data was missing from training set so it was omitted instead of making assumptions (like filling the missing values with mean or median) 

The training accuracy for this model was 80.53% and the Kaggle score on the test data with this model was "0.746"
